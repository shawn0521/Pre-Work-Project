<h2> Shawn's Icebreaker Extravaganza(Continued)!!!</h2>

<h3> 
    Hello and welcome to part II electric boogaloo of this website!
</h3>

<body>
    <p>So we have come to learn a little bit about me and some things I like, which is cool and all but I feel
        people dont talk about what they don't like enough. So since it is also part of the assignment I will be doing so with a table!
    </p>

<table width="50%" border="solid">
<tr>
<th>Things I Like</th>
<th>Things I Don't Like</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Long Youtube video essays about anything</td>
<td>The fruit known as the Coconut</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Any analog horror series</td>
<td>Having to watch analog horror</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Making my own sweet tea from scratch</td>
<td>Drinking any form of pulp</td>
</tr>
</table>

    <p>Now that the table is done and we have some insight to some more of my interests I thought I'd also share my type of comedy that I like.
        i felt that i could and should do so with a short video that I find funny.</p>
